I have done a course for advanced Python coding, and since you 
have kindly given us a free prompt for this project, I thought
I could use that to make a project that will not only be good for
this project, but also be good for my mom's business. 

I wanted to forewarn you about my knowledge with Python so that
it doesn't seem like I am cheating. Thank you!

Also, in order to run the code, go in the terminal for VSCode and 
type "streamlit run subtrack_app.py". It should open the website.
